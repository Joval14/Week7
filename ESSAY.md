An Industry Guide to Becoming a Software Engineer Essay


When I finished reading the content of the article I found myself with the following question: 
As a software engineer, what are the skills you need to have to be a success software engineer? 
You could summarize two answers. One that deals with non-technical skills and another that focuses on technology. 
To be a Software Engineer, you must have an affinity for technology in general, a constant development of skills and provide solutions according to what has been studied. 
To work in this industry is to understand also about the day to day of people and technology; on giving solutions applying technological 
innovations and being at the forefront of technology, to understand the functioning of some devices, create, learn, and thus improve or 
facilitate the lives of people. It is important to use technology to improve it, be curious and creative.

First, Practice your non-technical skills. The best software developers are constantly creating personal projects, testing new languages, design ideas and technologies. The learning of the great developers is always continuous. Also, it is necessary to have the ability and the habit or a system to develop the trade and improve each day, small daily advances add up in experience and skills. The software sector is changing and is always evolving, so the probabilities of that you need to learn a new language, platform or technology every year are very high. Improvement and continuous learning is the real skill that must be mastered. Technology is the developer's tool.
	
Second, to have a successful career, the article proposes a series of technological skills. Get used to high level languages. For example, C ++, These languages have been in the industry for a long time, and they will stay for a long time. Python is also useful. The world of programming always creates a technological revolution. Also, working on projects with other programmers will help improve the ability to work as a team and allow learning from others. Also, the application of knowledge in software engineering and development of solutions with the use of computer tools, is the most interesting aspect of this profession, because they allow providing software, hardware or infrastructure solutions, including simulating and optimizing processes, so put into practice all the knowledge and algorithmic coding skills participating in discussion forums is another way to success in this career. 
	
In conclusion; the design, management, programming, creativity, practice is a fundamental part of the principles of Software Engineering, is unique and organized. Probably the most difficult part is that software development can be as simple as a few lines of code, as it can be so complex that it requires the participation of thousands of specialists from different areas. Knowing how to get along with people who are software developers requires a set of technical and non-technical skills, some that start with humility and personality, and others that are technological and with extensive knowledge and practice. Which is essential for the continuous learning and experience in this industry.
